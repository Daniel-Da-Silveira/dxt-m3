#### Form editor page - side navigation closed

#### What we learned
- testing is ongoing
- having the links to the side significantly reduced cognitive overload and the ability to minimise the side navigation helped users have more space when adding new pages

##### What we learned

The following gaps were identified:
- most of the issues are summarised in [our heuristic evaluation](https://github.com/Daniel-Da-Silveira/defra-froms-mvp1/blob/main/app/design/Iterations/heuristic-evaluation.md) but the principle items that users found confusing was the array of green buttons at the top of the page, lack of page title, and button/link labels that didn't mean anything to them
