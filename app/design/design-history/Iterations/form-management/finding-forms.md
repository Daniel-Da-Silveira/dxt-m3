# Finding forms

## Key things we are designing for
- the ability to manage forms.
- specifically to finding existing forms

<br>

## Versions of the journey to finding an existing form that we have tested

### Version 3

#### Forms library

<br> *Page with a table that allows users to find a form by scanning their meta data, and use of the [MoJ sortable table component](https://design-patterns.service.justice.gov.uk/components/sortable-table/),and [GovUK pagination](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/pagination/#:~:text=For%20navigating%20between%20pages%20of%20items)*

## What we learned
- as a minimum viable product, this version had the most positive feedback in terms of meeting the core need of finding forms quickly
- future iteration should consider a search function to enable users to find forms even faster using keywords
- an update is needed to use the recently released versions of the [GovUK tag component](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/tag/)

### Version 2

#### Forms library

<br> *Page with “a table that allows users to find a form by scanning their meta data” *

## What we learned
- having the details about who created and last edited a form was found to be benificial to ensuring correct ownership and logging of activity. However, users found it difficult to find forms when the list was very long and without any form of filtering

### Version 1

#### Form designer existing forms list

<br> *Page that shows a table used to find and open existing forms in Xgov*


## What we learned

The following gaps were identified:
- users need the ability find a forms according to who they were created by, the status of the form, date of form creation, last edited by in order to find forms from a list that could potentially been in the hundreds
