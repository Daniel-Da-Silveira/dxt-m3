# Form statuses

## Key things we are designing for
- showing the status of forms so that I can track its progress

### Form statuses - Version 3

#### Statuses

<br> *Statuses*

#### Statuses in context of form editor
![form status tag in form editor pages v3](/app/design/assets/form-editor-status.svg)
<br> *Shows a form editor page with a form status above the H1*

<br>

## What we learned
- statuses helped user scan pages and keep track of what forms needed action
- users expect that when a new form is created that it automatically inherits a 'Draft' tag
- changing form status during the process of adding an internal note might fit into the content designers' workflow (to be tested)

<br> *Statuses: Published (is live on GOV.UK), Review (is being reviewed), Draft (is currently being iterated), Testing (is being tested internally or externally), Archived (is no longer being worked on and isn't published), Withdrawn (has been removed off live domains)*

<br>

#### Statuses in context of form library

#### Statuses in context of form editions

<br> *Statuses in the context of form editions*

<br>

## What we learned
- the tag component wasn't up to date with the latest version in the [GOV.UK design system](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/tag/) i.e., colours were slightly different and were all in uppercase
- a need for a 'preview' tag for when previewing a form either as a form editor or someone that has been sent a link to a prototype/form is something we need for MVP

### Version 1 
#### Statuses
![Form statuses v1](/app/design/assets/status-v1.svg)
<br> *Page that shows the first iteration of statuses we considered: Admin (can manage users, can manage forms, can review and manage submissions, can configure global settings‚Äù*

## What we learned

- the number of roles proposed was deemed out of scope for MVP and it was decided that we'd slim down our approach in MVP so that the role needed would grow when there is need to do so.
